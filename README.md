# Batch resize images using command line
This is an Interactive Shell Script to batch resize large images according to user preference.

First we need to install Imagemagick from the repository on Debian or Ubuntu:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install imagemagick -y
```

Paste the files in the 'original' folder, then run the following command and follow the instructions:
```shell
sh shrink.sh
```
